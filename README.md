# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for image classification on the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, a collection of grayscale images representing 10 fashion categories. The project explores various neural network configurations and optimization strategies to improve classification accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST, comprising 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) in 10 categories such as T-shirts, dresses, and sneakers.
- **Initial Setup**: A fully connected neural network with two hidden layers.
- **Optimization**:
  - **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid and ReLU.
  - **Regularization**: Dropout to mitigate overfitting.
  - **Error Function**: Cross-entropy loss.
  - **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loading and preprocessing Fashion MNIST data.
   - Splitting into training and testing datasets.
   - Normalizing pixel values for optimal training performance.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Initial training with Sigmoid activation, cross-entropy loss, and SGD.
   - Epochs = 10, Batch size = 1000.
   - Evaluation of training and testing accuracy.

3. **Model Refinement**:
   - Replacing Sigmoid activation with ReLU for efficiency and improved convergence.
   - Applying Dropout regularization to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting.
   - Comparing the results for insights into performance improvements.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Loss and accuracy metrics on training and test sets.
   - Visualization of results through tables and plots.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model building and training.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based platform for execution, leveraging GPU support.

## Results
- Comparative analysis of activation functions and regularization techniques.
- Insights into how ReLU and Dropout impact neural network performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow 2.6+ (Verify compatibility with your hardware and GPU).
- Other dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script in Google Colab or a local Python environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Scope
- Extend the model to more complex datasets.
- Explore advanced architectures like CNNs.
- Experiment with optimizers like Adam and RMSprop for comparative analysis.
